# Data Analysis Overview

## Introduction

Data analysis is the process of inspecting, cleaning, transforming, and modeling data with the goal of discovering useful information, drawing conclusions, and supporting decision-making. It encompasses a variety of techniques and tools to understand and interpret data to make informed decisions.

## Types of Data Analysis

Data analysis can be broadly categorized into several types, each serving different purposes:

### 1. Descriptive Analysis

Descriptive analysis focuses on summarizing and describing the main features of a dataset. It helps to understand what has happened over a specific period. This type of analysis includes the use of:

- **Measures of Central Tendency**: Mean, median, mode
- **Measures of Dispersion**: Range, variance, standard deviation
- **Visualization Tools**: Charts, graphs, histograms

### 2. Exploratory Analysis

Exploratory data analysis (EDA) is an approach to analyzing datasets to summarize their main characteristics, often using visual methods. EDA is used to:

- Detect patterns
- Spot anomalies
- Test hypotheses
- Check assumptions

Common tools for EDA include scatter plots, box plots, and correlation matrices.

### 3. Inferential Analysis

Inferential analysis aims to make inferences and predictions about a population based on a sample of data. It involves:

- **Hypothesis Testing**: Null and alternative hypotheses, p-values
- **Confidence Intervals**: Estimating population parameters
- **Regression Analysis**: Relationship between variables

### 4. Predictive Analysis

Predictive analysis uses statistical models and machine learning techniques to predict future outcomes based on historical data. It involves:

- **Regression Models**: Linear regression, logistic regression
- **Classification Models**: Decision trees, support vector machines, neural networks
- **Time Series Analysis**: Forecasting future values

### 5. Diagnostic Analysis

Diagnostic analysis examines data to understand the cause of outcomes and events. It helps answer the question of why something happened. Techniques include:

- **Correlation Analysis**: Identifying relationships between variables
- **Root Cause Analysis**: Identifying the underlying reasons for a problem

### 6. Prescriptive Analysis

Prescriptive analysis provides recommendations for actions to achieve desired outcomes. It combines data, algorithms, and business rules to suggest optimal decisions. Techniques include:

- **Optimization**: Linear programming, integer programming
- **Simulation**: Monte Carlo simulation
- **Decision Analysis**: Decision trees, scenario analysis
